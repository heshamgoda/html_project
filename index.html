<p>
really understand big data, it’s helpful to have some historical background. Here is Gartner’s definition, circa 2001 (which is still the

that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address 
business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.
