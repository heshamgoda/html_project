<h2>Big Data Challenges</h2>
<p>
While big data holds a lot of promise, it is not without challenges.
</p>
<p>
First, big data is…big. Although new technologies have been developed for data storage, data volumes are doubling in size about every two years. 
Organizations still struggle to keep pace with their data and find ways to effectively store it.
</p>
<p>
But it’s not enough to just store the data. Data must be used to be valuable and that depends on curation. Clean data, or data that’s 
relevant to the client and organized in a way that enables meaningful analysis, requires a lot of work. Data scientists spend 50 to 80 
percent of their time curating and preparing data before it can actually be used.
</p>
<p>
Finally, big data technology is changing at a rapid pace. A few years ago, Apache Hadoop was the popular technology used to handle big 
data. Then Apache Spark was introduced in 2014. Today, a combination of the two frameworks appears to be the best approach. Keeping up 
with big data technology is an ongoing challenge.
