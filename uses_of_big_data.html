<h2>Big Data Use Cases</h2>
<p>
<table border=black cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Product Development</th>
<td>
<p>
Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. They build predictive models for new 
products and services by classifying key attributes of past and current products or services and modeling the relationship 
between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. In addition, P&G uses data and analytics from focus groups, 
social media, test markets, and early store rollouts to plan, produce, and launch new products.

<tr>
<th>Customer Experience</th>
<td>
<p>
The race for customers is on. A clearer view of customer experience is more possible now than ever before. Big data enables you to 
gather data from social media, web visits, call logs, and other sources to improve the interaction experience and maximize the value 
delivered. Start delivering personalized offers, reduce customer churn, and handle issues proactively.

<tr>
<th>Machine Learning</th>
<td>
<p>
Machine learning is a hot topic right now. And data—specifically big data—is one of the reasons why. We are now able to teach 
machines instead of program them. The availability of big data to train machine learning models makes that possible.

<tr>
<th>Predictive Maintenance</th>
<td>
<p>
Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, such as the year, make, and model of equipment, 
as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. By analyzing 
these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively 
and maximize parts and equipment uptime.
